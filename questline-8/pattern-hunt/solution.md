# Pattern Hunt - Sequence Puzzle

## Problem
Find the next two terms in the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, ...
___

## Solution

### Step 1: Look at differences
- 6 - 2 = 4
- 12 - 6 = 6
- 20 - 12 = 8

The differences are increasing by 2: **+4, +6, +8, ...**
So the next differences are **+10, +12**.

Thus:
- Next term = 20 + 10 = **30**
- Next term = 30 + 12 = **42**
___

### Step 2: General formula
Each term follows the formula: n(n+1)
for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

- 1(2) = 2
- 2(3) = 6
- 3(4) = 12
- 4(5) = 20
- 5(6) = 30
- 6(7) = 42
___

## Final Answer
The next two terms are: 30, 42
